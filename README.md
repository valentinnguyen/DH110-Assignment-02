# Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction

Omegle is a free video chat website that allows people to socialize and connect with others. Users do not need to register or login to use the service, as it randomly and anonymously pairs users in private chat sessions. Omegle's aim is to connect people from all over, no matter where they are or who they are.

After conducting a heuristic evaluaion on the Omegle website, many usability concerns emerged, such as the following:
* Certain site features are difficult to find (or aren't there at all)
* The aesthetic design of the site is outdated and and cluttered
* Lack of recognition-based search design, so it relies on the user to remember their own inputs
* Lack of visability of system status, 
* Lack of help features,

Given these concerns, will will be conduct a usability test for Omegle to understand how much the site's usability features hinder's a user's ability to complete conventional tasks. The test will capture how effective and efficient the Omegle website is. Task 1 will ask the user to use the Omegle chatting servicing. Here, I will try to see how the user interacts with the inconsistencies of the website and how quickly they are able to complete their task. Task 2 will ask the user to repeat their previous task, but will now use the website's feature for college students. Finally, Task 2 will test the user's ability to see if they can find information on the site's privacy policies. This is to see if the user is able to quickly find information on how their data is being monitored and anonymous.

## Methodology

The pilot usability test will be conducted virtually over Zoom. The moderator and the participant will sit in the same video call and will interact with each other through the call feature. The moderator will record the session and the participant's reactions using Zoom's recording feature, while the participant will share their screen. This test is meant to experiment the setting, materials, and software to improve the usability testing process.
