# Pilot Usability Test

## Introduction

Omegle is a free video chat website that allows people to socialize and connect with others. Users do not need to register or login to use the service, as it randomly and anonymously pairs users in private chat sessions. Omegle's aim is to connect people from all over, no matter where they are or who they are.

After conducting a heuristic evaluaion on the Omegle website, many usability concerns emerged, such as the following:
* Certain site features are difficult to find (or aren't there at all)
* The aesthetic design of the site is outdated and and cluttered
* Lack of recognition-based search design, so it relies on the user to remember their own inputs
* Lack of visability of system status
* Lack of help and documentation features, which is not good for users that are less versed in technology

Given these concerns, I will be conduct a usability test for Omegle to understand how much the site's usability features hinder's a user's ability to complete conventional tasks. The test will capture how effective and efficient the Omegle website is. Task 1 will ask the user to use the Omegle chatting service. Here, I will try to see how the user interacts with the inconsistencies of the website and how quickly they are able to complete their task. Task 2 will ask the user to repeat their previous task, but will now use the website's feature for college students. Finally, Task 3 will test the user's ability to see if they can find information on the site's privacy policies. This is to see if the user is able to quickly find information on how their data is being monitored and anonymous.

## Methodology

The pilot usability test will be conducted virtually over Zoom. The moderator and the participant will sit in the same video call and will interact with each other through the call feature. The moderator will record the session and the participant's reactions using Zoom's recording feature, while the participant will share their screen. This test is meant to experiment the setting, materials, and software to improve the usability testing process. 

In the beginnning, the moderator will first introduce the usability test process to the participant. Then, the participant will give their informed consent and will fill out a pre-test questionnaire that indicates their first impressions of the Omegle website. Afterwards, the participant will complete three tasks while talking and thinking aloud as they go through them. Once they have completed all three tasks, the participant will then fill out a post-test questionnaire about their personal reactions to the website's effectiveness, efficiency, learnability, aesthetics, and overall design and organization. Additionally, the participant will select give words that relates to their opinions about the website. Lastly, the participant will fill out their demographic information, which will be confidential.

## Reflection
This pilot usability test has taught me a lot about what it is like to facilitate a usability test, as well as the usability of the Omegle website. For the Omegle website, I learned that it is a lot more intuitive to use than I thought, and that I might have been a bit too critical when thinking of ways in which the site could be better. However, the participant had many similar thoughts than me in that the Omegle site was outdated and not visually appealling, even thought it was pretty straight forward.

For the actual making of the usability test, I learned about how difficult it was to create tasks for a website that does not have many features. I, myself, had a hard time trying to figure out the different features of the site when finding tasks for the participant to do. I also learned that the moderator must have a lot of patience when watching the participant use the site, since I had already gone through the app and am more familiar with its features than the participant was. I found myself wanting to tell the participant how to perform their tasks, but had to remember to hold myself back and let them try to figure it out themselves. Moreover, I learned how useful it is for the participant to talk and think aloud while they are doing their tasks, as it gives me verbal reassurance that I can understand what they're thinking as they go through the website. 

Overall, I think that this pilot usability test went well. I think it could have been longer, and I wish I knew more about the Omegle interface so that I could ask the participant to do more specific and fun tasks. There were some minor issues, such as a few typos on the survey itself, but otherwise the test ran pretty smoothly, and I learned a lot from it.
